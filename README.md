## Unique Features & Advantages

### Why This Module Is Different

Most infrastructure management solutions require external monitoring tools, manual intervention, or complex orchestration systems to detect and fix issues. This module takes a fundamentally different approach:

1. **Built-In Self-Healing**: Unlike traditional Terraform modules that only deploy resources, this module embeds healing capabilities directly within the infrastructure it creates.

2. **No External Dependencies**: Doesn't rely on external monitoring tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Prometheus - everything is self-contained using native AWS services.

3. **Proactive vs. Reactive**: Instead of waiting for alerts that require human intervention, this module automatically detects and fixes issues in real-time.

4. **Configuration Drift Protection**: Automatically detects and reverts unauthorized changes to your infrastructure, maintaining your desired state without requiring `terraform apply`.

5. **Reduced Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Healing actions happen within minutes of detecting an issue, dramatically reducing downtime.

6. **Comprehensive Observability**: Provides detailed logs and metrics about healing events, giving you visibility without requiring manual intervention.

### Advanced Usage

#### Customizing Healing Behavior

You can customize the healing behavior for different environments:

```hcl
# Development environment: more lenient thresholds
module "dev_database" {
  source = "github.com/yashodhan271/terraform-aws-self-healing-infrastructure/modules/self-healing-rds"
  
  # Basic configuration...
  
  # More lenient healing configuration
  drift_check_interval     = 30  # minutes
  max_healing_attempts     = 5
  cpu_threshold            = 90  # percent
  free_storage_threshold   = 1073741824  # 1 GB in bytes
  max_connections_threshold = 200
}

# Production environment: stricter thresholds
module "prod_database" {
  source = "github.com/yashodhan271/terraform-aws-self-healing-infrastructure/modules/self-healing-rds"
  
  # Basic configuration...
  
  # Stricter healing configuration
  drift_check_interval     = 5   # minutes
  max_healing_attempts     = 2
  cpu_threshold            = 70  # percent
  free_storage_threshold   = 5368709120  # 5 GB in bytes
  max_connections_threshold = 80
}
```

#### Integrating with Existing Monitoring

While the module is self-contained, you can integrate it with your existing monitoring systems:

```hcl
# Forward healing notifications to an existing monitoring system
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "forward_to_pagerduty" {
  topic_arn = module.self_healing_infrastructure.sns_topic_arn
  protocol  = "https"
  endpoint  = "https://events.pagerduty.com/integration/abcdef123456/enqueue"
}
```

## How Self-Healing Works

### EC2 Self-Healing

1. **Status Check Failures**:
   - CloudWatch alarms detect when EC2 status checks fail
   - Lambda function attempts to reboot the instance
   - If reboot fails, the instance is stopped and started
   - If the issue persists, the Lambda function can terminate and recreate the instance

2. **Configuration Drift**:
   - Scheduled Lambda function checks instance configuration against desired state
   - Detects changes to instance type, security groups, tags, etc.
   - Automatically reverts unauthorized changes
   - Records drift events and healing actions in CloudWatch Logs

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - CloudWatch alarms monitor CPU, memory, and disk metrics
   - When thresholds are exceeded, Lambda function takes appropriate action
   - Actions include scaling vertically, optimizing resources, or rebooting

### RDS Self-Healing

1. **Database Failures**:
   - Monitors RDS status and performance metrics
   - Automatically reboots the instance if it becomes unresponsive
   - Can initiate failover to a standby instance if available

2. **Storage Issues**:
   - Monitors free storage space and disk I/O
   - Automatically increases allocated storage when running low
   - Optimizes storage performance based on workload

3. **Configuration Drift**:
   - Detects changes to instance class, parameter groups, security groups
   - Automatically reverts to the desired configuration
   - Prevents unauthorized changes from affecting database performance

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin by implementing self-healing for your most critical resources.

2. **Monitor Healing Events**: Review the CloudWatch logs and metrics to understand healing patterns.

3. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune thresholds based on your application's behavior and requirements.

4. **Test Healing Scenarios**: Deliberately introduce failures in non-production environments to verify healing works as expected.

5. **Combine with IaC Best Practices**: Use this module alongside other Terraform best practices like state locking, versioning, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **AWS-Specific**: This module is designed specifically for AWS resources.
- **Stateful Resources**: Some healing actions may cause brief downtime for stateful resources.
- **Complex Failures**: Extremely complex failure scenarios might still require manual intervention.
- **Cost Considerations**: The Lambda functions and CloudWatch alarms will incur some AWS charges.

## Roadmap

Future enhancements planned for this module:

- Support for additional AWS resource types (ECS, EKS, Lambda)
- Multi-region healing capabilities
- Enhanced machine learning for predictive healing
- Integration with AWS Control Tower and Organizations
- Support for cross-account healing
